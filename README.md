# Clustering-Customer-Segmentation-Targeting

### Project Background

Where2go is an online hotel booking website in China, which accounts for more than 50% market shares. Last year, they started a new project which aims to exploit the value of clickstream data.
They have generated two datasets based on the raw clickstream data: ***CUSTOMER_LEVEL*** data and ***PURCHASE*** data.
All the users in the dataset are mobile users. The marketing team wants to understand their customer base better. Through customer segmentation and profiling, they can improve targeting when launching a hotel price discount campaign.

Please note all outputs from this project are generated using Radiant (R package). The purpose of this project is to understand cluster analysis and interpretation of model outputs. Model accuracy and validation are not the focus of this project.
